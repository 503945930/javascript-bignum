INSTALLATION

Copy bigrational.js and biginteger.js from this directory to your
JavaScript directory.

Browse Matt's famous BigInteger documentation at
<http://silentmatt.com/biginteger/> or create it by installing
NaturalDocs and running the build-docs script in
javascript-biginteger.

Suffer the incomplete BigRational documentation by making what sense
you can of the files bigrational.js and test/test-bigrational.js in
this distribution.  Accept my apologies if this situation has
persisted over a month since the initial release.
