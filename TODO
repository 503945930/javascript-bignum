TODO:

* Apply Vitaly Magerya's BigInteger performance patch
  (comp.lang.scheme thread circa 2011-02-09)

* Consider providing the option not to tamper with Number.prototype.

* BigInteger: Consider having pow() reject non-integer arguments.

* Consider aliasing or renaming BigInteger.toString() so as not to
  conflict with the default toString().

* Consider a BigDecimal class like Java's BigDecimal.

* Consider creating a framework for selecting implementations of
  BigInteger (and perhaps alternatives to EQFraction or even
  Rectangular).  The library could dynamically measure usage and swap
  implementations on-the-fly to improve performance.
