TODO:

* Make it easy to choose among different implementations of exact
  integers, exact rationals, and complex numbers.

* Give users control over whether or not we use Number.prototype.

* Consider supporting a configuration where inexact reals are returned
  as primitive numbers but Number.prototype is not used.

* Avoid "for (x in y)" out of concern for Object.prototype use.

* Implement integers using another library, such as Leemon Baird's.

* Consider a BigDecimal class like Java's BigDecimal.

* Consider creating a framework for selecting implementations of
  BigInteger (and perhaps alternatives to EQFraction or even
  Rectangular).  The library could dynamically measure usage and swap
  implementations on-the-fly to improve performance.
