TODO:

* More tests.

* More documentation.

* Consider hooking BigRational parse() into
  BigInteger.parse.expandExponential to support syntax like
  "1.234*10^3" but of course retain fractional parts.

* New methods as per the ECMA spec for Number.prototype:
  toLocaleString, toFixed, toExponential, toPrecision.  Consider
  inheriting from Number.

* Consider having BigInteger pow() reject non-integer arguments.

* Consider automatically converting integer BigRational values to
  BigRationalInteger.

* Consider aliasing or renaming BigInteger.toString() so as not to
  conflict with the default toString().  Give BigRationalInteger and
  BigRational a similar interface.

* Consider exposing the library version like BigRational.VERSION ===
  BigInteger.VERSION === "1.0"
