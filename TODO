TODO:

* Fix (expt 0 0) in maint branches as per the example in R6RS.

* Backport fix: (angle 1.0) must be inexact.

* Decimal: Test and debug.

* Leemon Baird BigInt wrapper: optimize.  Add exactIntegerSqrt.

* Provide a choice among different implementations of complex numbers
  and inexact reals.

* Support primitive numbers as exact values using conditionals,
  typeof, and lifting as in js-numbers.

* Evaluate Nixysa, a NPAPI generator, for the GMP plugin:
  http://code.google.com/p/nixysa/

* Finish the GMP plugin and create integer, rational, and inexact
  implementations on it.  Interface design ideas: Flusspferd
  (http://flusspferd.github.com/) GMP module, node-gmp
  (https://github.com/postwait/node-gmp), node-bigint
  (https://github.com/substack/node-bigint).  Consider hybrid
  implementations with runtime optimal threshold discovery, since the
  plugin may or may not be in-process, and in-process calls can be
  over 100x faster than out-of-process.

* Consider avoidance or mitigation of GMP calls to abort().

* Reimplement the performance benefit of using Number.prototype for
  inexact, but make it optional.

* Implement (rnrs arithmetic bitwise) functions.

* Think about what to do with "#e1@1".

* Consider supporting a configuration where inexact reals are returned
  as primitive numbers but Number.prototype is not used.

* Consider supporting primitive numbers as exact values using
  Number.prototype.

* Avoid "x in y" out of concern for Object.prototype use.

* Consider supporting continuation-passing style for the benefit of
  Scheme(?) and PPAPI.

* Consider merging the plugin architecture into D. Yoo's js-numbers.

* Consider type implementations that dynamically measure usage and
  change representations on-the-fly to improve performance (run-time
  optimization).
